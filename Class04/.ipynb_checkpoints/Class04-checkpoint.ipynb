    "We are going to work with classifier models today. We start with a sample dataset from Sebastian Thrun's Udacity Machine Learning course. Here's the scenario: we are building a self-driving car. We have mapped out the course we are taking and created a dataset that indicates, on a scale from 0 to 1, how bumpy the road is and, on the same scale, how steep the road is (measured in \"grade\"). For each road we need to know whether we should have the car drive \"slow\" or \"fast\". For example, we want to slow down for bumpy roads. But we may want to speed up when we are going up steep hills. I've created a sample dataset from fake data that maps this out. We start by loading and plotting the data."
